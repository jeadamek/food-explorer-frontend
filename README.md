# Food Explorer App

This is the final project of Explorer course at the [Rocketseat School](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/). To access the entire course assignments click [this link](https://github.com/jeadamek/explorer-rocketseat). 

The task of this project involved creating the user interface of an application using the ReactJs library. Food Explorer front-end works in conjunction with the [Food Explorer API](https://github.com/jeadamek/food-explorer-api). 

Food Explorer is a responsive web application that allows admins to manage dishes, orders, and clients, while clients can create accounts, place orders, and manage their profiles.

The project's preview can be seen below:<br/>

   - Once logged in as an admin, you can perform the following actions:

     - **Add a New Dish**: Click on the "Add Dish" button on the admin dashboard. Fill in the required details such as dish name, description, ingredients, and an optional image. Click "Save" to add the new dish to the menu.

     - **Edit an Existing Dish**: On the admin dashboard, find the dish you want to edit in the dish list. Click on the dish card to open the edit form. Modify the necessary fields and click "Save" to update the dish details.

     - **List Orders**: On the admin dashboard, navigate to the "Orders" tab to view a list of all orders. The orders are displayed in a table format, showing the order ID, client details, order status, and total amount.

     - **Update Orders**: From the admin order list, you can update the status of an order by selecting the desired status from the dropdown menu in the corresponding row. Clicking "Save" will update the order status.
